# Introduction
The React and Redux Blog Page project is a web application that provides a user-friendly interface for managing a blog. It incorporates real-time API integration to fetch and display blog posts, enabling users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on posts. The application utilizes React, Redux for state management, Axios for API requests, React Hooks for component logic, and includes features like a search bar, author list, and various CRUD functionalities.

# Technologies Used
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Redux: A state management library for managing application state.
* Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
* React Hooks: Functions that allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features.
* Real-Time API: An API that provides real-time updates when new data is available.
#Features
1. Fetch and Display Blog Posts
The application fetches blog posts from a real-time API and displays them on the main page. This allows users to see the latest posts as they are published.

2. CRUD Operations
Create: Users can create new blog posts by filling out a form and submitting it. The new post is added to the list of posts.
Read: Users can view the details of each blog post by clicking on it.
Update: Authors can edit the content of their own posts. Changes are reflected in real time.
Delete: Authors can delete their posts, and the post is removed from the list.
3. Search Bar
A search bar allows users to search for specific blog posts based on keywords or topics. The search results are displayed instantly.

4. Author List
The application maintains a list of authors, allowing users to identify who wrote each post. Clicking on an author's name can display their other posts.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
